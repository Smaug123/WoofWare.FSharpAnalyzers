WOOF-TCS-ASYNC | Warning | (12,14--12,42) | TaskCompletionSource<T> created without TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously. This can cause continuations to run inline on the calling thread, leading to deadlocks, thread-pool starvation, and corruption of state. Always use: new TaskCompletionSource<T>(TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously). Suppress with comment including text 'TaskCompletionSource without RunContinuationsAsynchronously allowed'.

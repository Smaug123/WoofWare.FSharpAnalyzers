WOOF-RETURN-BANG-ONLY | Info | (4,35--4,40) | Computation expression consists only of 'return!'. This is likely unnecessary indirection - consider using the inner value directly. While this can introduce laziness through the builder's Delay method, this is usually a code smell and the computation expression can be removed.
